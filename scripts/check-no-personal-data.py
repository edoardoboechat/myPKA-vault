"""check-no-personal-data.py — release gate against maintainer data in the scaffold.

WHY THIS EXISTS
    v1.8.2 swept the author's first name out of the scaffold and the job was
    called done. v3.0.0 shipped the Cockpit, which reintroduced ~100 literal
    mentions plus a real person's health context, and nothing noticed for 48
    days because the only check that existed looked for `Edoardo` — a
    token that was, correctly, absent the whole time. A guard whose passing
    state is reachable without the thing being true is worse than no guard.

    So this checks the actual claim: no maintainer's personal data ships.

WHY THE NAMES ARE NOT IN THIS FILE
    This script ships inside the scaffold. Hardcoding a maintainer's name here
    would put that name in every member's folder, which is precisely what the
    guard exists to prevent. Names live in a config file that is NOT shipped
    (`.privacy-guard.json`, marked export-ignore in .gitattributes).

CONFIG  (.privacy-guard.json at the repo root, optional)
    {
      "forbidden_names": ["Ada", "Lovelace"],
      "allowed": ["Dr. Ada Lovelace"]
    }
    `allowed` holds EXACT strings that are legitimate (a formal authorship
    credit, a historical figure quoted in sample content). Add an exact string
    rather than widening a pattern.

USAGE
    python3 scripts/check-no-personal-data.py [--root .] [--require-config]
    exit 0 = clean, exit 1 = findings (prints file:line for each)

    --require-config makes a missing or name-less config a FAILURE. CI uses it,
    so this gate can never quietly degrade to patterns-only and report green.
